# Name: Makefile
# Project: Micronucleus
# License: GNU GPL v2 (see License.txt)

# Controller type: ATtiny 85 - 16.5 MHz
# Configuration:   Default + FAST_EXIT_NO_USB_MS=300 + LED
# Last Change:     Jun 16,2020

# Enable safe optimizations. This will disable several unnecesary instructions in microncleus to save around 12 more bytes.
# These optimizations disables entering the bootloader with jmp 0000, which you should not do anyway - better use the watchdog timer reset functionality.
#
# Disabled features:
#   * No SREG initialization in CRT, especially no unnecesary reset of interrupt enable, which is disabled after reset. - saves 2 bytes
#   * No Stackpointer initialization in CRT. Datasheet says: Initial Value RAMEND - saves 8 bytes
#   * Setting the GIMSK or EIMSK register directly instead of keeping other bits. GICR contains other bits, which must be kept! - saves 2 bytes
#     We only want one interrupt to be enabled, so keeping the other bits makes no sense.

# Not needed, since we are not over the page boundary
#CFLAGS += -DENABLE_SAFE_OPTIMIZATIONS  # This saves 10 bytes and disables reliable jump to 0x0000, which one should avoid anyway.

# hexadecimal address for bootloader section to begin. To calculate the best value:
# - make clean; make main.hex; ### output will list data: 1592 (or something like that)
# - for the size of your device (8kb = 1024 * 8 = 8192) subtract above value = 6598
# - How many pages in is that? 6598 / 64 (tiny85 page size in bytes) = 103.09377
# - round that down to 103
# - our new bootloader address is 103 * 64 = 6592, in hex = 19C0
# - For data size up to 1600 the address is 19C0 for size from 1601 to 1664 the address is 1980
