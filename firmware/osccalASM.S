/* Calibrate the RC oscillator. Our timing reference is the Start Of Frame
 * signal (a single SE0 bit) repeating every millisecond immediately after
 * a USB RESET. 
 *
 *
 * Benefits:
 *    - Codesize reduced by 90 bytes.
 *    - Improved robustness due to removing timeout from frame length measurement and 
 *      inserted NOP after OSCCAL writes.
 *
 * Changes:
 *    - The new routine performs a combined binary and neighborhood search
 *      in a single loop.
 *      Note that the neighborhood search is necessary due to the quasi-monotonic 
 *      nature of OSCCAL. (See Atmel application note AVR054).
 *    - Inserted NOP after writes to OSCCAL to avoid CPU errors during oscillator
 *      stabilization. 
 *    - Implemented new routine to measure frame time "usbMeasureFrameLengthDecreasing".
 *      This routine takes the target time as a parameter and returns the deviation.
 *    - usbMeasureFrameLengthDecreasing measures in multiples of 5 cycles and is thus
 *      slighly more accurate.
 *    - usbMeasureFrameLengthDecreasing does not support time out anymore. The original
 *      implementation returned zero in case of time out, which would have caused the old
 *      calibrateOscillator() implementation to increase OSSCAL to 255, effictively
 *      overclocking and most likely crashing the CPU. The new implementation will enter
 *      an infinite loop when no USB activity is encountered. The user program should
 *      use the watchdog to escape from situations like this.
 * Update 2014-01-4
 *    - Added an initial sync-state, which will discard the first delay measurement. 
 *      This allows to call this routine before or during the SE0 bus reset without 
 *      corrupting OSCCAL.
 *     - Removed CLI/SEI to allow more flexibility.
 * 
 * 
 * This routine will work both on controllers with and without split OSCCAL range.
 * The first trial value is 128 which is the lowest value of the upper OSCCAL range
 * on Attiny85 and will effectively limit the search to the upper range, unless the
 * RC oscillator frequency is unusually high. Under normal operation, the highest 
 * tested frequency setting is 192. This corresponds to ~20 Mhz core frequency and 
 * is still within spec for a 5V device.
