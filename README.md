# Bootloader for Digispark / Micronucleus Firmware
### Version 2.5 - based on the firmware of [micronucleus v2.04](https://github.com/micronucleus/micronucleus/releases/tag/2.04)

Here I forked the firmware part of [micronucleus repository](https://github.com/micronucleus/micronucleus) and try to add all improvements and bug fixes I am aware of. To make the code better understandable, I also added a lot of comment lines.

# How to update the bootloader to the new version
To **update** your old flash consuming **bootloader**, open the Arduino IDE, select *Tools/Programmer: "Micronucleus"* and then run *Tools/Burn Bootloder*.<br/>
![Burn Bootloader](https://github.com/ArminJo/DigistumpArduino/blob/master/pictures/Micronucleus_Burn_Bootloader.jpg)<br/>
The bootloader is the recommended configuration [`entry_on_power_on_no_pullup_fast_exit_on_no_USB`](firmware/configuration#recommended-configuration).<br/>
Or run one of the window [scripts](https://github.com/ArminJo/micronucleus-firmware/tree/master/utils)
like e.g. the [Burn_upgrade-t85_default.cmd](utils/Burn_upgrade-t85_default.cmd).

# Driver installation
For Windows you must install the **Digispark driver** before you can program the board. Download it [here](https://github.com/digistump/DigistumpArduino/releases/download/1.6.7/Digistump.Drivers.zip), open it and run `InstallDrivers.exe`.

# Installation of a better optimizing compiler configuration
**The new Digistmp AVR version 1.6.8 shrinks generated code size by 5 to 15 percent**. Just replace the old Digispark board URL **http://digistump.com/package_digistump_index.json** (e.g.in Arduino *File/Preferences*) by the new  **https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArminJo/DigistumpArduino/master/package_digistump_index.json** and install the **Digistump AVR Boards** version **1.6.8**.<br/>

# Configuration overview is [here](firmware/configuration#configuration-overview)

# New features
## MCUSR content now available in sketch
In this versions the reset flags in the MCUSR register are no longer cleared by micronucleus and can therefore read out by the sketch!<br/>
If you use the flags in your program or use the `ENTRY_POWER_ON` boot mode, **you must clear them** with `MCUSR = 0;` **after** saving or evaluating them. If you do not reset the flags, and use the `ENTRY_POWER_ON` mode of the bootloader, the bootloader will be entered even after a reset, since the power on reset flag in MCUSR is still set!<br/>
For `ENTRY_EXT_RESET` configuration see *Fixed wrong ENTRY_EXT_RESET* below.

# Pin layout
### ATtiny85 on Digispark

```
                       +-\/-+
 RESET/ADC0 (D5) PB5  1|    |8  VCC
  USB- ADC3 (D3) PB3  2|    |7  PB2 (D2) INT0/ADC1 - default TX Debug output for ATtinySerialOut
  USB+ ADC2 (D4) PB4  3|    |6  PB1 (D1) MISO/DO/AIN1/OC0B/OC1A/PCINT1 - (Digispark) LED
                 GND  4|    |5  PB0 (D0) OC0A/AIN0
                       +----+
  USB+ and USB- are each connected to a 3.3 volt Zener to GND and with a 68 Ohm series resistor to the ATtiny pin.
  On boards with a micro USB connector, the series resistor is 22 Ohm instead of 68 Ohm. 
  USB- has a 1k pullup resistor to indicate a low-speed device (standard says 1k5).                  
  USB+ and USB- are each terminated on the host side with 15k to 25k pull-down resistors.
```

### ATtiny167 on Digispark pro
Digital Pin numbers in braces are for ATTinyCore library

```
                  +-\/-+
RX   6 (D0) PA0  1|    |20  PB0 (D8)  0 OC1AU
TX   7 (D1) PA1  2|    |19  PB1 (D9)  1 OC1BU - (Digispark) LED
     8 (D2) PA2  3|    |18  PB2 (D10) 2 OC1AV
INT1 9 (D3) PA3  4|    |17  PB3 (D11) 4 OC1BV USB-
           AVCC  5|    |16  GND

    12 (D6) PA6  9|    |12  PB6 (D14) 3 INT0  USB+
     5 (D7) PA7 10|    |11  PB7 (D15)   RESET
                  +----+
  USB+ and USB- are each connected to a 3.3 volt Zener to GND and with a 51 Ohm series resistor to the ATtiny pin.
  USB- has a 1k5 pullup resistor to indicate a low-speed device.
  USB+ and USB- are each terminated on the host side with 15k to 25k pull-down resistors.

# Digispark clone and originals
On the photos below you see from left-to-right: a clone, an old genuine and a new genuine board. The clone is larger. You can tell from the locations of the (zener)diodes with respect to the Attiny85 and the powerLED orientation.
The value of the USB pullup resistor on a genuine Digispark Micro-USB is 1 kOhm (102). The series resistors are 22 Ohm.

# Revision History
### Version 2.5
- Saved 22 bytes by converting USB_INTR_VECTOR in *usbdrvasm165.inc* from ISR with pushes to a plain function.
- Saved 2 bytes by improving small version of usbCrc16 in *usbdrvasm.S*.
- Saved 4 bytes by inlining usbCrc16 in *usbdrvasm.S*.
- Renamed `AUTO_EXIT_NO_USB_MS` to `FAST_EXIT_NO_USB_MS` and implemented it.
- New configurations using `FAST_EXIT_NO_USB_MS` set to 300 ms.
- Light refactoring and added documentation.
- No USB disconnect at bootloader exit. This avoids "Unknown USB Device" entry in device manager.
- Gained 128 byte for `t167_default` configuration.

- Fixed destroying bootloader for upgrades with entry condition `ENTRY_EXT_RESET`.
- Fixed wrong condition for t85 `ENTRYMODE==ENTRY_EXT_RESET`.
- ATtiny167 support with MCUSR bug/problem at `ENTRY_EXT_RESET` workaround.
- `MCUSR` handling improved.
- no_pullup targets for low energy applications forever loop fixed.
- `USB_CFG_PULLUP_IOPORTNAME` disconnect bug fixed.
- New `ENTRY_POWER_ON` configuration switch, which enables the program to start immediately after a reset.
